Itâ€™s the only good part of the quarantine time we liveâ€¦</p><p>This time I bring to you my point of view of the <strong>Angstrom CTF</strong> Iâ€™ve entered in march, from 14th to 19th. I tooked a bit more than the usual ctfâ€™s but it worth it, mostly because I could learn a lot during the game. I think it was the first time I could reverse some stuff (3 challenges) using <code>Ghidra</code> and <code>gdb</code> - it was really cool! ðŸ˜Ž</p><p>This ctf competition had Misc, Web, Crypto, Binary and Rev categories with 47 total challenges. During the five competition days I could manage to solve ten of them, and the eleventh I took the flag a few minutes after the end of the competition. Bad luckâ€¦</p><p>I ended up in <strong>592<sup>nd</sup> place</strong> with 575 points.
