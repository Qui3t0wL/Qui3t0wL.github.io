I ended in 253rd place out of 748 teams. Saddly, I only entered in the second day of the competition and only managed to solve 2 challenges. One easy and another one more complex. The first one was a kind of one-point-challenge and the other was a USB capture with some input devices communicating in. Recently, I did a similar challenge in HTB where I had to decode the keyboard inputs. In this challenge I had to extract a zip file with a text file inside, but firtly I needed to found the password that protects the zip file. The password was in the keyboard inputâ€¦ My walkthrought it&#39;s in my github repo.","categories":[{"name":"CTF","slug":"CTF","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/categories/CTF/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Forensics","slug":"Forensics","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Forensics/"},{"name":"PCAP","slug":"PCAP","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/PCAP/"}]},{"title":"</ Hello World >","slug":"hello-world","date":"2020-02-01T23:28:05.279Z","updated":"2020-02-01T23:28:05.279Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/01/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/2020/02/01/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Like programming, this is my first post here.
