It&#39;s the only good part of the quarantine time we live… This time I bring to you my point of view of the Angstrom CTF I&#39;ve entered in march, from 14th to 19th. I tooked a bit more than the usual ctf’s but it worth it, mostly because I could learn a lot during the game. I think it was the first time I could reverse some stuff (3 challenges) using Ghidra and gdb - it was really cool! :smile: This ctf competition had Misc, Web, Crypto, Binary and Rev categories with 47 total challenges. During the five competition days I could manage to solve ten of them, and the eleventh I took the flag a few minutes after the end of the competition. Bad luck… I ended up in 592nd place with 575 points. You can view my complete writeup in my github repo. The organizers release a public repository with the solves for the challenges at https://hackmd.io/@ZX59lFiyRu6ODiM2rFw7Wg/ry5FDNeI8#","categories":[{"name":"CTF","slug":"CTF","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/categories/CTF/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Forensics","slug":"Forensics","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Forensics/"},{"name":"PCAP","slug":"PCAP","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/PCAP/"},{"name":"Rev","slug":"Rev","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Rev/"},{"name":"Web","slug":"Web","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Web/"},{"name":"Crypto","slug":"Crypto","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Crypto/"}]},{"title":"HackTM CTF 2020","slug":"hacktm-ctf-2020","date":"2020-02-11T12:06:13.000Z","updated":"2020-02-11T12:42:40.703Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/11/hacktm-ctf-2020/","link":"","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/2020/02/11/hacktm-ctf-2020/","excerpt":"","text":"To start february in the best way I managed to participated in a CTF to improve my forensics skills - the HackTM CTF (Quals) 2020. I ended in 253rd place out of 748 teams. Saddly, I only entered in the second day of the competition and only managed to solve 2 challenges. One easy and another one more complex. The first one was a kind of one-point-challenge and the other was a USB capture with some input devices communicating in. Recently, I did a similar challenge in HTB where I had to decode the keyboard inputs. In this challenge I had to extract a zip file with a text file inside, but firtly I needed to found the password that protects the zip file. The password was in the keyboard input… My walkthrought it&#39;s in my github repo.","categories":[{"name":"CTF","slug":"CTF","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/categories/CTF/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Forensics","slug":"Forensics","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/Forensics/"},{"name":"PCAP","slug":"PCAP","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/tags/PCAP/"}]},{"title":"</ Hello World >","slug":"hello-world","date":"2020-02-01T23:28:05.279Z","updated":"2020-02-01T23:28:05.279Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/01/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://qui3t0wl.github.io/2020/02/01/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Like programming, this is my first post here.
